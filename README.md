# Chess Game UI with Pygame

This project is a **simple chess game UI** built using **Pygame** and **python-chess**. It allows players to visualize and interact with chess moves on a graphical chessboard. The focus is on creating a user-friendly interface and handling chessboard interactions, not on implementing AI or advanced game logic.

## **Features**

- **Graphical Chessboard**: An interactive chessboard rendered using Pygame.
- **Custom Chess Pieces**: Load and display custom chess piece images.
- **Legal Moves Highlighting**: Shows possible legal moves and highlights selected pieces.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Click to select and move pieces.
- **Basic Chess Rules**: Enforces turn order and move legality.

### **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Pygame**: For rendering the game interface.
- **python-chess**: For handling chess logic.
